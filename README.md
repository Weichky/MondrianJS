# Mondrian-style Color Block Generator

A JavaScript project for generating random Mondrian-inspired color blocks. The coordinate generator can be extracted and used independently with your own rendering logic.

For more on the design approach and implementation, see my blog: [Weichky's Blog](https://blog.weichky.com)

## Notes & Personal Context

This is one of the first complete projects I ever finished and marks the start of my programming journey. It carries personal significance as a small yet meaningful step.

My limited prior experience in C/C++ naturally led me to JavaScript for simplicity. The initial motivation was to experiment with game development, recalling that JavaScript was once usable in Unity (now replaced by C#). In any case, this has been a useful exercise in establishing a coding foundation. The project itself is modest—please forgive any roughness.
